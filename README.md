# Statistical-Machine-Learning-Project-1
Predicting authors of test tweets from among a very large number of authors found in training tweets. The Project also builds generic skills in problem solving, critical analysis, presentation/communication, and team work â€“ all critical for practical SML. 
Authorship attribution has several applications. One is for identifying who wrote an ancient
text to better understand its historical context; or similarly in literature, for books written under a pen name.
Authorship attribution is closely related to plagiarism detection: did a student really submit this essay, or a
professional essay writer? A related area is stylometric attacks in privacy research: online authors who might
want to write text critical of their government or employer may go to pains to hide their IP address and name,
but they should understand that their writing style can give their identity away. Demonstrating that authorship
attribution is possible out in the open helps raise awareness to privacy risks of how data is collected, shared and
released.
Finally, authorship attribution is an interesting application of so-called xtreme classification when

framed as massively multiclass classification. Our hope is that you will look into some (not necessarily all) of
these areas in developing your Project submissions. While you might like to use some NLP.
